<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>	Come to Dookii’s wonderful pet grooming store

<p> In 2025 Jonathan Stuppin was tired of all these dogs smelling bad. He made it his mission to keep doggies clean. After launching his business, he started selling pets out of the store front as well. These includes dogs and cats as well as pet birds and iguanas. The owners are now Samantha and Patrick O’brian. </p>
